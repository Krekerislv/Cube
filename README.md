### Software
The software generates two files. The file with .lcaf extension contains a 4D array that represents the 3D cube animation frames in time.
It is possible to create new animations using the editor or upload animation files (with .lcaf extension) and view them in the home page.
When an animation is created, it is saved in the local storage and will remain there until the user clears the application data.

To upload the animation to the iCubeSmart 8x8x8 rgb cube the user has to download the file with .gc extension. The software automatically generates the .gc file that is in binary format and can be uploaded to the compiler.
